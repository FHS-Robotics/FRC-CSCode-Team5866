Hello 4th Period!
Mark Dannemiller here.

Thanks for taking interest in the programming side of this competition!
This is the class folder that your team will use to create the WpiLIB Java project 
for your class' drive base.


My plan is that Thursday(11/4/19) I'll host a workshop to teach you guys how to use Visual
Studio Code and Github in parallel.  Please try to be there. It will be useful if you bring a 
personal laptop, as VS Code with the FRC Suite doesn't work on our classroom desktops because of 
the restrictions set forth by the administrators.  I guess they're just against progress...  Instead, I'm 
trying to get us supplied with classroom laptops- those will be more useful to us anyways for what we're
doing- but until then if you have a personal laptop then that will be easier for setting up your 
client-side repository and the programming environment. 

If you don't know what that means or if you don't have a PC, don't be discouraged! No matter your experience, 
theres a lot to learn in joining the programming team and we're going to have some fun this year.  
What's nice about Github is that all of our projects are connected, meaning you can go an look at what the other classes 
have already done if you get stuck.  That's called open-source, and Github was created as a giant marketplace
of free information and code for all sorts of applications.  Don't be afraid to look up any problems in writing
the driving code you create and use Google; Google is your best friend now.  Also I'll be available for any questions
you guys might have just ask Mr. Holloway to relay the message to me or I'll work out some means of contact with everyone.

Don't mess with anything until we have that meeting Thursday.  If no one from your group can make it, just tell Mr. Holloway.
By then I'll have created an in-depth tutorial(hopefully) for downloading Visual Studio Code, the Labview Update suite, and 
the Github extension for VS Code.  Also, having a Github account will be needed so I'm sure you guys can figure out how to
create an account.  I'll also include in the tutorial an explanation how to join our group on Github, "FHS-Robotics".

In the mean time, watch some of these videos to learn some information about Git and FRC programming with Java.
(I'll keep updating it with more helpful videos)

Here's the tutorial for installing VS Code on your computer:

Also, feel free to look around on the repository and its history to see what we've already done and to gain an understanding
of the whole Git workflow.  I'm still learning a lot about it, and have created my own workflow that I hope will work for a large
group as well, so if there's some bumps along the way it's alright I'll sort it out.  That's the benefit of doing all of this before
the season!  If you have any tips or know more about Git than me, tell me about them.  I'm in 8th period and my email is

It's unlikely that your team will need to split up and create that many git branches, because this project will really only
have the driving code, so that will include the Robot class, RobotMap class, OI class, and the TeleOpDrive command.  you
can reference the code within the project file from this previous 2019 season to see how we have it all laid out.  Really this
project can be done with just the "Robot.java" file, but go ahead and make the other ones, even if they're pretty bare and plain,
just so that you can see the basic structure that keeps the robot organized no matter how complex it may get.
